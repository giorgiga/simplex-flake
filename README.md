# simplex-flake

This is where I am preparing nixos packages and modules for the SimpleX Chat
servers ([simplexmq](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq)), and also the
client ([simplex-chat](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/)).

The packages/modules will be submitted to nixpkgs when ready, so unless you are
here to help out with testing you'll probably want to have nothing to do with
this repo.
